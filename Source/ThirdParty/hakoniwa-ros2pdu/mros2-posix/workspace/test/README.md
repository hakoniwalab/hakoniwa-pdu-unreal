# Test applications for mros2-posix communication layers

These apps have been developed for testing communication of UDP and RTPS packet, and they were helpful in the eraly stage of development.
However, they are no longer buildable due to major changes in directory structure, etc.
We plan to maintain them in the near future, as they remain useful (see #1).

* lwIP layer: [udp_multicast](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-posix/tree/main/workspace/test/udp_multicast)
(embeddedRTPS and lwip-posix)
* embeddedRTPS layer: [fastdds-comp](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-posix/tree/main/workspace/test/fastdds-comp)
